## Prerequisites

The following, is required to be installed before you can begin using MOOSE.

- +Xcode Command Line Tools (CLT)+. To install CLT on your machine, open a terminal and run:

  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

  If you do not have both Xcode and CLT installed, you will be presented with a dialog box allowing you to install CLT. There are two choices, 'Get Xcode' and 'Install'. Choose 'Install' to install CLT. We will need Xcode as well, but choosing 'Get Xcode' will send you to the App Store and will ultimately fail if you are not running the lastest version of Mac OS.

- +Xcode+. Log into [Apple's Developer](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/more) website (iTunes account required) and obtain the appropriate version of Xcode pertaining to your version of Mac OS. Once downloaded, you will need to extract the Xcode-*.xip file, and move the Xcode.app to your /Applications folder. Once that is done, you must then open Xcode to complete the installation.

- +Download and install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)+

- +High Sierra 10.13+: [!package!name arch=osx10.13]
