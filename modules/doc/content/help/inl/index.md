# INL Applications and Remote Access

[!ac](INL) builds and maintains a wide range of MOOSE-based applications as well as [!ac](HPC)
support for these applications. The following links will aid researchers learning more about the
available codes and how to utilize the [!ac](INL) resources to run applications.

## Requesting Access id=access

INL applications may be obtained by outside institutions and individuals for execution and/or
development. Currently, the following access methods are available for certain applications.

- +HPC Binary Access+\\
  Users in the category will be provided an INL-HPC account that includes a binary version of
  the desired application ready for use on INL-HPC resources.

- +Binary Access+\\
  Users in this category will be provided with access to a binary version of the desired
  application that is executable on non-INL systems, such as a personal workstation or institution
  cluster.

- +Source Code Access+\\
  Users in this category will be provided with complete source code access to an application. This
  level of access is reserved for individuals that will be developing new capabilities for the
  application and contributing directly to the project.


The request access to an [!ac](INL) developed code, please contact follow the instructions
on [INL Modeling and Simulation Software](https://modsimcode.inl.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx) website.
