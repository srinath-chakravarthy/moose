!card! gallery/elder.gif title=Density driven, porous flow with adaptivity
Density driven, porous flow simulation of the Elder problem using [Falcon](https://github.com/idaholab/falcon).  Mesh adaptivity is used to accurately capture the moving fronts.

A 3D spinodal decomposition modeled with Cahn-Hilliard equations using third-order Hermite elements with
the [phase field module](modules/phase_field/index.md).

!card! gallery/dipole_antenna.gif title=2D Half-Wave Dipole Antenna
The 2D electric field radiation pattern of a broadcasting half-wave dipole antenna, modeled using
the [VectorMooseVariable.md] system with first-order Nedelec elements.

!card! gallery/grain_tracker.gif title=3D Grain Tracking
The [GrainTracker](GrainTracker.md) is a utility that dramatically reduces the number of order
parameters needed to model a large polycrystal system with the phase-field module. This video shows
the dynamic remapping that occurs as "reused" order parameters get too close to one and other as the
simulation evolves.

!card! level_set/vortex_out.gif title=Vortex Benchmark
The level set equation is commonly used to for interface tracking, especially when the interface
velocity is known. MOOSE contains a level set module, for more information see [level_set/index.md].

!card! gallery/soil.gif title=Soil desiccation simulation
A 3D soil desiccation simulation using phase-field for cohesive fracture model, see
[A phase-field formulation for dynamic cohesive fracture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09691).
