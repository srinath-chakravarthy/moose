# Remote Access Tips

With many people working from home, you may want to take a few minutes to configure your system for remote access. Please see our [Remote HPC Connectivity](help/inl/hpc_remote.md) instructions.

!card! gallery/golem_app_reservoir_analysis.gif title=Faulted Geothermal Reservoirs
Evolution of the 100C temperature during 30 years of injection/production for a complex doublet
system into a fractured geothermal reservoir. Based on [GOLEM](https://github.com/ajacquey/golem),
a MOOSE based application for thermo-hydro-mechanical simulations of fractured reservoirs.

!card! gallery/laser_welding.gif title=Laser Melt Pool
Using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation a laser is rotated around the surface of a stainless
steel block. The steel first melts and then begins to evaporate. The recoil force from evaporation
deforms the surface of the melt pool which in turn drives flow in the melt pool interior. Melt flow
is determined using the incompressible [Navier-Stokes](modules/navier_stokes/index.md) equations
while mesh deformation is determined using a linear elasticity equation.

Transient flow around corner using Euler equations with variable porosity,

!card! gallery/elder.gif title=Density Driven, Porous Flow with Adaptivity
Density driven, porous flow simulation of the Elder problem using [Falcon](https://github.com/idaholab/falcon).  Mesh adaptivity is used to accurately capture the moving fronts.

Process of dendritic crystal growth, which is an anisotropic nucleation process as presented by
[Modeling and numerical simulations of dendritic crystal growth](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727899390120P).

A 3D spinodal decomposition modeled with Cahn-Hilliard equations using third-order Hermite elements with
the [phase field module](modules/phase_field/index.md).

!card! gallery/dipole_antenna.gif title=2D Half-Wave Dipole Antenna
The 2D electric field radiation pattern of a broadcasting half-wave dipole antenna, modeled using
the [VectorMooseVariable.md] system with first-order Nedelec elements.

!card! gallery/grain_tracker.gif title=3D Grain Tracking
The [GrainTracker](GrainTracker.md) is a utility that dramatically reduces the number of order
parameters needed to model a large polycrystal system with the phase-field module. This video shows
the dynamic remapping that occurs as "reused" order parameters get too close to one and other as the
simulation evolves.

!card! level_set/vortex_out.gif title=Vortex Benchmark
The level set equation is commonly used to for interface tracking, especially when the interface
velocity is known. MOOSE contains a level set module, for more information see [level_set/index.md].

!card! gallery/soil.gif title=Soil Desiccation Simulation
A 3D soil desiccation simulation using phase-field for cohesive fracture model, see
[A phase-field formulation for dynamic cohesive fracture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09691).
