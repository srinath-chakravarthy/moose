In conjunction with the upcoming TMS 2020 Annual Meeting in San Diego, we will be offering a training course on phase-field modeling using the MOOSE framework. The course will give an overview of the theoretical background of the phase-field method, how it is implemented in the MOOSE framework, and how other physics can be coupled to phase-field models to predict microstructural evolution and properties. There will be two tutorial sessions where participants will gain hands-on experience working through example problems. (For the hands-on portion, participants should bring their own laptops to work on.)
