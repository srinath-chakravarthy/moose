# Progressively adding potassium feldspar

This page follows Chapter 13 of [!cite](bethke_2007) and involves computing the equilibrium system as K-feldspar is added to a hypothetical water.

The initial composition of the water is shown in [table:composition].  Assume that the temperature is 25$^{\circ}$C and the pH is 5.  $0.15\,$cm$^{3}$ of K-feldspar is slowly added to this system.

!table id=table:composition caption=Initial bulk composition of the hypothetical water
| Species | Concentration (mg/kg(solvent water)) |
| --- | --- |
| HCO$_{3}^{-}$ | 50 |
| Cl$^{-}$ | 30 |
| Ca$^{2+}$ | 15 |
| SiO$_{4}^{2-}$ | 8 |
| Na$^{+}$ | 5 |
| Mg$^{+}$ | 3 |
| SiO$_{2}$(aq) | 3 |
| K$^{+}$ | 1 |
| Al$^{3+}$ | $10^{-3}$ |

[!cite](bethke_2007) predicts that the minerals kaolinite, muscovite, quartz, K-feldspar and phengite all precipitate, and that kaolinite dissolves, as the K-feldspar is gradually added to the solution.  See [!cite](bethke_2007) Figure 13.1 and 13.2.

MOOSE produces the result ????
