# The impact of CO$_{2}$ fugacity on the solubility of calcite

Section 14.3 of [!cite](bethke_2007) and involves studying the solubility of calcite in the presence of a progressively changing CO$_{2}$ gas buffer.

Assume that:

- the bulk composition of Na$^{+}$ is 10$\,$mmolal;
- the bulk composition of Cl$^{-1}$ is 10$\,$mmolal;
- the mineral calcite is used in place of Ca$^{2+}$ in the basis, and that initially it has a free volume of 0.5$\,$cm$^{3}$;
- CO$_{2}$(g) is used in place of H$^{+}$ in the basis, and that its fugacity is initially $10^{-3.5}$;
- charge balance is maintained on HCO$_{3}^{-}$.

Then the fugacity of CO$_{2}$(g) is changed from $10^{-3.5}$ to 1, and the dissolution of calcite, the pH, and species concentrations are all recorded as a function of time.

[!cite](bethke_2007) presents results in Figures 14.6 and 14.7.
