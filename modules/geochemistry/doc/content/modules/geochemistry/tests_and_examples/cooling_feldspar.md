# Cooling a solution in contact with feldspars

This page follows section 14.1 of [!cite](bethke_2007) and involves computing the equilibrium system as a solution in contact with feldspars is cooled.

The initial composition of the water is shown in [table:composition].  In addition, the "albite low" mineral is supressed (its precipitation is disallowed).  The system is initialised at 300$^{\circ}$C and slowly cooled to 25$^{\circ}$C.

!table id=table:composition caption=Initial composition
| Species | Concentration |
| --- | --- |
| Na$^{+}$ | 1 molal (bulk) |
| Cl$^{-}$ | 1 molal (bulk) |
| Albite (in place of Al$^{3+}$) | 20 cm$^{3}$ (free) |
| Maximum microcline (in place of K$^{+}$) | 10 cm$^{3}$ (free) |
| Muscovite (in place of H$^{+}$) | 5 cm$^{3}$ (free) |
| Quartz (in place of SiO$_{2}$(aq) | 2 cm$^{3}$ (free) |


[!cite](bethke_2007) predicts that microcline slowly precipitates, albite slowly dissolves, while muscovite and quartz remain largely unchanged.  See [!cite](bethke_2007) Figure 14.1.

MOOSE produces the result ????
