# Kinetically-controlled dissolution of albite into an acidic solution

Section 16.4 of [!cite](bethke_2007) describes the gradual dissolution of albite into an acide solution, as governed by a kinetic rate law.  The reaction is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Albite} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{Na}^{+} + \mathrm{Al}^{3+} + 3\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\mathrm{(aq)} - 4\mathrm{H}^{+} \ ,
\end{equation}
with rate
\begin{equation}
r = A_{s}k a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\left( 1 - \frac{Q}{K} \right) \ .
\end{equation}
It is assumed that:

- there is 1$\,$kg of solvent water in addition to:

  - 0.1 molal Cl$^{-}$,
  - 0.1 molal Na$^{+}$,
  - $10^{-6}$ molal SiO$_{2}$(aq),
  - $10^{-6}$ molal Al$^{3+}$;
- the temperature is 70$^{\circ}$C;
- initially 500$\,$g of "albite low" is added to the water;
- the specific surface area is $A_{s} = 1000\,$cm$^{2}$/g(albite low);
- the rate constant is $k=6.3\times 10^{-13}\,$mol.cm$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$;
- the pH is fixed at 1.5

[!cite](bethke_2007) presents the results in Figure 16.1 for a simulation time of 30 days.  The MOOSE results are ????
