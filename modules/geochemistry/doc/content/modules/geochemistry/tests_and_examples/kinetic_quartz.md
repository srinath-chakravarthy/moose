# Kinetically-controlled dissolution of quartz

Section 16.4 of [!cite](bethke_2007) describes the gradual dissolution of quartz into deionized water, as governed by a simple kinetic rate law.  The reaction is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Quartz} \rightarrow \mathrm{SiO}_{2}\mathrm{(aq)} \ ,
\end{equation}
with rate
\begin{equation}
r = A_{s}k \left( 1 - \frac{Q}{K} \right) \ .
\end{equation}
It is assumed that:

- there is 1$\,$kg of water;
- the temperature is 100$^{\circ}$C so that $\log_{10}K = -3.0951$;
- initially 5000$\,$g of quartz is added to the water;
- the specific surface area is $A_{s} = 1000\,$cm$^{2}$/g(quartz);
- the rate constant is $k=2\times 10^{-15}\,$mol.cm$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$;
- the initial concentration of SiO$_{2}$(aq) is $10^{-6}\,$mmolal.

[!cite](bethke_2007) presents the results in Figure 16.1 for a reaction time of 5 days.  The MOOSE results are ????
