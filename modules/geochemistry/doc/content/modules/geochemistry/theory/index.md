# Theory behind the geochemistry module

The `geochemistry` module is designed to solve reactive transport in geochemical systems.  The `geochemistry` module's functionality is a subset of that described in the authoratative, pedagogical textbook [!cite](bethke_2007).  In order of help users understand the concepts of geochemical modelling, the `geochemistry` theory documentation uses notation and ideas drawn from this textbook, so readers will undoubtably find the textbook invaluable.
