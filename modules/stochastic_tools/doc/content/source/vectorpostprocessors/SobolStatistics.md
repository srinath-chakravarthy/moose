# SobolStatistics

!syntax description /VectorPostprocessors/SobolStatistics

## Overview

This object computes the Sobol sensitivity indices following the procedure defined by
[!cite](saltelli2002making). This includes the first-order and total-effect indices and optionally
the second-order indices as well. The SobolStatistics object only operates on result data
generated from Sobol-based sampling strategy, which is provided by the [SobolSampler.md].

## Example Input File Syntax

The following input snippet uses the GFunction test object, which is defined as:

!equation
g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n\frac{|4x_i-2|+q_i}{1+q_i},

where $\vec{q}$ is defined in the input file, $x$ is the vector of model data, and $n$ is the number
of input variables. The $x$ data is generated by the Sobol sampler object.

The resulting data includes a single list of all the computed statistics, in the following order:
$S_1,\ldots,S_n,S^T_1,\ldots,S^T_n, S_{21}, S_{31}, S_{32}, S_{41}, S_{42}, S_{43},\ldots$, where
$S_i$ give the first-order indices, $S^T_i$ are the total-effect indices, and $S_{ij}$ are
the second-order indices for $i=1\ldots n$, $j=1\ldots n$ for $i\neq j$.
